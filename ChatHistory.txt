Chat history between Cursor and me for building an hourglass app

0 First of all I gave Cursor the specification of the app in Japanese 
of which translation into English is shown in HourGlassSpecificatin.txt.
This specification is almost same as the one I had in mind when I myself created a similar hourglass app.
Here I emphasize that I gave Cursor the Japanese version but not the English one 
and if I gave one in English,then the following process might have resulted in another direction.
Instructions below and annotations in Python code are also in Japanese.
1 Cursor built the first app as soon as it read the specification,
and then it showed the figure as in hourclockcursor1.png.
In the figure all the components of hourglass are shown correctly,
but they are not assembled into an hourglass. 
At first moment seeing the figure, I couldn't get to know what they were.
2 I gave Cursor several instructions to assemble the components into an hourglass,
but they were in vain as shown in hourclockcursor2.png through 8.
In hourclockcursor6.png I saw the sand falling being colored yellow,though.
3 I told Cursor to cancel the continuous operation mode from the specification 
and sketched an overview of the hourglass which Cursor is seemingly going to build 
and showed it to Cursor under the name of "CursorPlanedOverview.png" and gave it an instruction to imitate it and try to assemble.
Then, Cursor succeeded in assembling glass parts into a glass container of sand as shown in hourclockcursor9.png.
But the frame remained disassembled into pillars and tori.
4 I gave several instructions to connect pillars to the upper and lower tori,but in vain
as shown in hourclockcursor9.png through 13.
5 I gave an instruction to change colors of tori to make it sure that Cursor recognizes them correctly.
Then,Cursor changed colors correctly as in hourclockcursor14.png.
6 I gave several instructions to connect pillars from the lower green torus to the upper blue one in vain
as shown in hourclockcursor15.png through 16.
7 I gave an instruction to remove all pillars and tori.
Then Cursor executed the instruction successfully as shown in hourclockcursor17
which shows just a glass container of sand.
8 I gave an instruction to bring back two tori and flatten them a little bit.
Then, Cursor did it successfully as in hourclockcursor18.png and 19.
9 I gave several instructions to connect just one pillar to the lower and the upper tori in vain
as shown in hourclockcursor20.png through 22.
10 I gave an instruction again to connect just one pillar to tori,
then intentionally Cursor changed the method to draw the pillar and succeeded in connecting it
as shown in hourclockcoursor23Goodjob.png.
11 At this moment I got a view that if other three pillars were connected like as the one connecting successfully,
then the frame would be completed and so the whole hourglass itself would be.
12 But unfortunately Cursor told me that my no-pro quota had been exhausted.
After then I couldn't continue this project any longer.
